    "submission_text": "--- Page 1 ---\na. Zone C has the lowest level of dissolved oxygen.\nb. Dissolved oxygen and biological oxygen demand have an inverse relationship. When one is increased the other is decreased.\nc. Zone B is most likely when there is point-source water pollution.\nd. The independent variable in this experiment is the dissolved oxygen levels.\ne. An increase in dissolved oxygen levels will also lead to an increase in macroinvertebrate species.\nf. The researchers selected Zone A as the control because it is the zone before the point-source pollution is introduced.\ng. The cooler temps in winter months could alter the results of the investigation.\nh. The introduction of raw sewage decreases the amount of dissolved oxygen which is needed by the bacteria. Without the oxygen the bacteria can not break down organic matter and the population will decrease.\ni. Another abiotic factor that could influence the population size is the increase in sediments.\nj. Persistent organic pollutants can decrease or even wipe out populations on the lower trophic levels. Without the populations of the lower trophic levels, the higher trophic level populations will also decrease in population.",
